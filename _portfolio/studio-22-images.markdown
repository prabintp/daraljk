**Mission:**

  To develop a modern identity that tied into the business modal of the company, but also included an elegant, feminine touch.

**Implementation:**

  Several designs were originally hand-drawn for consideration, with six individual identities later recreated in Illustrator as vector objects in grayscale.

  Because the studio is female owned-and-operated, the client wanted an identity that would be bold enough for use as a watermark on images, but still retained a subtleness and delicate look up-close. The final center graphic of a pinwheel-like flower was decided upon as an homage to a camera's aperature blades, while still retaining a feminine impression.

  A brand style guide (shown above) was created for the client to uphold consistent branding standards in not only its identity, but also its philosophy, typeface and coloring.
