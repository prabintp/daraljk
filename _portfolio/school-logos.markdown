**Mission:**

  To rebrand [Taft](http://mpsaz.org/taft), [Keller](http://mpsaz.org/keller) and [Stevenson](http://mpsaz.org/stevenson) Elementaries with modern identities that would afford the schools a more professional look on printed and web materials.

**Implementation:**

  Since each school already had specific mascots, the goal of each project was to modernize the appearance of each school's brand and allow them to convey their high-quality educational experiences with parents and community members who would have otherwise dismissed their identities as being too "cute" or "outdated" in a professional setting.

  Each logo was hand-drawn after input from each school's administration and then converted to vector marks in Illustrator. After several tweaks, each school approved their new identities and the imagery was used on new printed collateral and marquees posted outside their locations.
