**Mission:**

  To display complex information in an easy-to-read medium to employees who may have not previously known, or heard of, any of the information shared.

**Implementation:**

  Pages were developed in conjunction with several Mesa Public Schools departments, including Human Resources, Research & Evaluation, Superintendency and Communications & Marketing. The final product was approved, printed at the in-house print shop and mailed to all 9500 district employees.
