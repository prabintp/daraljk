**Mission:**

  To develop a look and brand theme for display in listing advertisements for Hecht Homes and several other Security Title Agency realtors.

**Implementation:**

  Security Title Agency had contracted our work to design several collateral pieces for their real estate clients including Hecht Homes, among many others.

  Most real estate pamphlets are mundane, often including dark color themes and dated call-outs that scream dated design practices. Our goal was to create attractive pieces that would entice potential customers to pick up the informational sheet and want to read it, whether they were in the market to buy a home or not.

  Real estate advertisements can be tricky. Usual there is a lot of text associated with describing the home, which must also be exciting and inviting to read. The key points need to be highlighted in areas that make sense and the choice of images can be crucial to the rate at which a home sells.

  The designs for Hecht Homes and the other real estate agents we designed collateral for were extremely well-received. Unfortunately, due to changes to regulation in federal law, RESPA (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act) no longer allowed for title agencies to market their real estate agents in the same manner.
